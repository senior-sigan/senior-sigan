## Hi there 👋

I’m a 👨‍💻 software engineer at [7bits](https://7bits.it/) with experience in 🤖 machine learning and data analysis. 

Also I work on my 👨‍🎓 Ph.D dissertation on Neural Network to draw anime 🌸.

In spare time I 🧙‍♂️ teach students coding and machine learning at [Omsk State University](https://omsu.ru/) and [IT-lift](http://itlift.1der.link/).

Here in Omsk I started an [Machine Learning community](https://vk.com/mlomsk) [back in 2017](https://vk.com/wall-141957789_2) to evolve this field in my hometown.

My interests are neural networks, game development and teaching.
